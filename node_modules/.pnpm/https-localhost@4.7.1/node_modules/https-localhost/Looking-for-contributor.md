# I'm looking for contributors!
I would like to totally rewrite this package in a brand new version 5 and I'm looking for help!  
With the right help I would also like to switch to an organization on GitHub for advanced features.

## What we want to do
- [ ] Port https-localhost in TypeScript (from JS). I'm working on it and I would like to discuss the final structure of the module.
- [ ] Improve the CLI with option and config files.
- [ ] Evaluate if make sense to split into two separate packages: the CLI and the module. The new CLI may add new dependency and many users use it as module.
- [ ] Switch to more lightweight dependencies (possibly replacing express) to reduce the module size. Evaluate the remotion of less user features that have dependencies (e.g. compression, minify).
- [ ] Structured docs.
- [ ] Publish on brew.
- [ ] Improve the Actions: CI, Release, automatic dependencies upgrade and more.
- [ ] Write a VSCode extension that integrates this project into the IDE.
- [ ] Evaluate Deno compatibility support: lately, some tools for automatic rewriting of imports are coming out, reducing the burden.
- [ ] Optionally, implement a minimal UI (an executable with drag & drop) for users who are not comfortable with the CLI.


## Who I'm looking for
- Stable **maintainers**, to discuss the project together and take design choices.
- Casual **contributors**, who would like to work on a feature or on a task, improve docs, optimize code or fix bugs.
- **Testers**, who can help us find bugs and verify the correct functioning of patches and new features.

### What you need
- Ability to work in a team
- Patience, courtesy, and respect
- Desire to get involved and build something useful

#### Appreciated, but not required to contribute
- TypeScript/javaScript knowledge (but at least desire to learn it, of course!)
- Experience designing a module or a project implementation

### What to keep away
- Presumption
- Claims (of money, power, or other benefits): it's a free, open-source project


## What I can offer
- All my thankfulness and gratitude
- A place in the Contributors section of the README.md (that will be created soon)
